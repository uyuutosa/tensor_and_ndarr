1. array is able to be viewed with following format
a =
[0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]

b =
[[0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]
 [2.00e+00 3.00e+00 ]
 [4.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]

2. Binary operation is supported.
a + 2 - a * a / 4 =
[2.00e+00 2.75e+00 ]


3. So-called 'broadcast' tecnhnic is supported.
a + b = [0 1] + [[0 1], [2 3], [4 5]] =
[[0.00e+00 2.00e+00 ]
 [2.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]
 [4.00e+00 6.00e+00 ]]

a + b + c + d + e + f + g
 = {is also able to be calculeted but too big to output.}

4. Product of dot, cross and diad is suported.
The dot product of a and b is 
[[1.00e+00 3.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]
 [1.00e+00 3.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]
 [1.00e+00 3.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]

The cross product of d and c is 
[[0.00e+00 -2.00e+00 -4.00e+00 ]
 [0.00e+00 -2.00e+00 -4.00e+00 ]
 [0.00e+00 -2.00e+00 -4.00e+00 ]]

The diadic product of a and b is 
[[[[0.00e+00 0.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 0.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 0.00e+00 ]]
  [[0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]]]
 [[[0.00e+00 2.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 2.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 2.00e+00 ]]
  [[0.00e+00 3.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 3.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 3.00e+00 ]]]
 [[[0.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]]
  [[0.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]
   [0.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]]]


5. Universal function is roughly supported.
sin(b) = 
[[0.00e+00 8.41e-01 ]
 [9.09e-01 1.41e-01 ]
 [-7.57e-01 -9.59e-01 ]]

fabs(b) = 
[[0.00e+00 1.00e+00 ]
 [2.00e+00 3.00e+00 ]
 [4.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]


6. Transpose is supported.
b's dimension transpose [0,1] to [1,0] as fllows.
[[0.00e+00 2.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]
 [1.00e+00 3.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]

c's dimension transpose [0,1,2] to [0,2,1] as fllows.
[[[0.00e+00 2.00e+00 4.00e+00 ]
  [1.00e+00 3.00e+00 5.00e+00 ]]
 [[6.00e+00 8.00e+00 1.00e+01 ]
  [7.00e+00 9.00e+00 1.10e+01 ]]
 [[1.20e+01 1.40e+01 1.60e+01 ]
  [1.30e+01 1.50e+01 1.70e+01 ]]
 [[1.80e+01 2.00e+01 2.20e+01 ]
  [1.90e+01 2.10e+01 2.30e+01 ]]]

c's dimension transpose [0,1,2] to [2,1,0] as fllows.
[[[0.00e+00 6.00e+00 1.20e+01 1.80e+01 ]
  [2.00e+00 8.00e+00 1.40e+01 2.00e+01 ]
  [4.00e+00 1.00e+01 1.60e+01 2.20e+01 ]]
 [[1.00e+00 7.00e+00 1.30e+01 1.90e+01 ]
  [3.00e+00 9.00e+00 1.50e+01 2.10e+01 ]
  [5.00e+00 1.10e+01 1.70e+01 2.30e+01 ]]]


7. Other utility menber function is provided a little.
min(b) =  0.00e+00
sum(b) =  5.00e+00
sum(b) =  1.50e+01
mean(b) =  2.50e+00
